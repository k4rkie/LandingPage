# Landing Page

This is a simple **landing page** project built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is my first full webpage build that isnt that responsive but was only built to apply the things that I have learned and to document it.

## Features

- Uses semantic HTML5 elements
- Styled with custom CSS
- Easy to customize and extend

## How to View

You can open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the landing page.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/k4rkie/LandingPage.git
